## What it does

This app pulls from its database a list of burgers (and whether or not they've been eaten). Affordances are made for eating a burger, and ordering another once eaten. You can also add a new burger, if your favorite kind isn't currently on the menu.

## How it does

This app uses a mixture of Express.JS and Handlebars.JS to deliver the front end, as well as managing communication with the MySQL server on the back end. Throw in some CSS and a transparent PNG for spice, cook until at least half-baked, serve and enjoy!

## See it in action!

## How to get started
1. Make sure you have MySQL v5 or later installed
2. Clone the git repo with that shiny green button up there in the top right
3. Import the `db/schema.sql` and `db/seeds.sql` files with your MySQL database manager of choice
4. `npm install`
5. `node server.js`
6. Access the page from any web browser @ http://localhost:8080
7. Marvel at this ridiculously over-built way to keep track of some fast food
